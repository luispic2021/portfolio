# Python Fundamentals – SWE Prep (Week 1)

This document defines the core Python fundamentals I will focus on during my 6-month SWE transition.  
These topics were chosen based on:
- interview requirements
- my personal skill gaps
- the technical demands of Permabot and my backtesting engine

---

## 1. Core Language Fundamentals
- Functions (parameters, defaults, return values)
- Loops (for, while) + control flow (break, continue)
- Conditionals (if/elif/else)
- Error handling (`try / except / finally`)
- List, dict, set operations
- String manipulation
- Comprehensions (list/dict/set)
- Modules & imports
- File I/O (read/write)

---

## 2. Backend-Relevant Python Concepts
- OOP basics: classes, methods, instance vs class variables
- Dataclasses (`@dataclass`)
- Type hints (`typing`)
- Clean folder & module structure
- Logging (`logging`)
- Environment variables (`os.getenv`)
- JSON parsing & validation
- Time handling: `datetime`, timezones, formatting

---

## 3. Testing & Code Quality
- pytest basics
- Fixtures
- Mocking API calls
- Writing small unit tests for helper functions
- Structuring tests per module
- Test-driven mindset (write function → write test → refine)

---

## 4. Code Organization & Clean Code
- Single-responsibility functions
- Clear naming
- Avoiding side effects in functions
- Using helper modules cleanly
- Returning values instead of printing
- Writing docstrings

---

## 5. Backend Mindset Fundamentals
- How to design a small utility cleanly
- How to structure a project into modules
- How to separate logic from I/O
- How to think in terms of inputs → transformations → outputs

---

## 6. Stretch Fundamentals (Later Weeks)
_Not urgent for Week 1, but I’ll deepen these as I go:_
- Async basics (`asyncio`)
- Decorators
- Generators & iterators
- Context managers (`with`)

---

## Week 1 Goal
By the end of Week 1, I should be able to:
- write small scripts without Copilot
- structure a mini project cleanly
- write basic tests
- read and understand Python code fluently
